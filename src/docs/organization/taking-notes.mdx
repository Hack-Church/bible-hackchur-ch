title: Taking Notes
---

Taking good notes can save you a lot of frustration. It's not uncommon to find yourself a dozen steps down a rabbit hole for your target machine to disconnect only to realize you've forgotten how to get back to where you were.

## Notable Items
Here is a list of things you might want to keep track of:
- Target IPs
- Target scans
- Credentials (even partial)
- CTF flags
- Commands used
- Exploit steps and attempts

Taking notes can be as simple as writing a text file, or as complex as using a dedicated application to organize your notes with something like [Cherry Tree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/).

## Output Redirection
Often times its as simple as redirecting the `stdOut` or `stdErr` of a command to a file.

Write current directory listing to notes
```sh
ls > [output]
```
- `output` filename to write to

Append somefile contents to notes
```sh
cat [somefile] >> [output]
```
- `somefile` path to a source file
- `output` filename to append to

## Tool Output

Even though you could easily use output redirection to save tool output, many tools have built in export methods that may offer additional formats better suited for automation:

Save `nmap` output to a file
```sh
nmap [target] -oN [output] // normal output
nmap [target] -oX [output] // XML output
nmap [target] -oA [output] // all outputs
```
- `target` target machine IP
- `output` base name of the file
