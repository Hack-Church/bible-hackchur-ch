title: Taking Notes
---

Taking good notes can save you a lot of frustration. It's not uncommon to find yourself a dozen steps down a rabbit hole for your target machine to disconnect only to realize you've forgotten how to get back to where you were.

Taking notes can be as simple as writing a text file, or as complex as using a dedicated application to organize your notes with something like [Cherry Tree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/).

## Output Redirection
Often times its as easy as writing the `stdOut` or `stdErr` of a command to a file.

Write current directory listing to notes:
```bash
ls > notes
```

Append somefile contents to notes:
```bash
cat somefile >> notes
```

## Nmap Scans

Save an `nmap` scan of `192.168.1.1` to `myScan`
```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1 -oN myScan
```
