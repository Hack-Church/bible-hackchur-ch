title: Taking Notes
---

Taking good notes can save you a lot of frustration. It's not uncommon to find yourself a dozen steps down a rabbit hole for your target machine to disconnect only to realize you've forgotten how to get back to where you were.

## Notable Items
Here is a list of things you might want to keep track of:
- Target IPs
- Target scans
- Credentials (even partial)
- CTF flags
- Commands used
- Exploit steps and attempts

Taking notes can be as simple as writing a text file, or as complex as using a dedicated application to organize your notes with something like [Cherry Tree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/).

## Output Redirection
Often times its as simple as redirecting the `stdOut` or `stdErr` of a command to a file.

Write current directory listing to notes
```bash
ls > output
```
- `output` filename to write to

Append somefile contents to notes
```bash
cat somefile >> output
```
- `output` filename to append to

Save an `nmap` scan to a file
```bash
nmap target -oN output
```
- `target` target machine IP
