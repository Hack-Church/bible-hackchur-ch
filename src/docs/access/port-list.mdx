## Common Ports
Ports from `0` through `1023` are well known ports. On most systems, services run on well-known ports require superuser privileges. Ports `1024` through `49151` are registered ports and typically do not require superuser privileges. Both well-known and registered ports are typically running a known service on that port, but it is **not guaranteed**.

Below is a list of ports commonly used in gaining access to a target:

- `21` [FTP](/access/ftp)
- `22` [SSH](/access/ssh)
- `23` [Telnet](/access/telnet)
- `25` [SMTP](/access/smtp)
- `53` [DNS](/access/dns)
- `80` [HTTP](/access/http)
- `88` [Kerberos](/access/kerberos)
- `110` [POP3](/access/pop3)
- `143` [IMAP](/access/imap)
- `443` [HTTPS](/access/https)
- `3000` [HTTP](/access/http), [Ruby On Rails](/access/ruby-on-rails), [Meteor](/access/meteor)
- `5601` [Kibana](/access/kibana)
