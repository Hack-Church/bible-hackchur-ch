## Basic connection
```bash
ssh user@target
```

## Forward Tunnel with Local Listener
```bash
ssh -L 2000:target2:22 user@target1
```
- `2000` local port
- `22` remote port

## Reverse Tunnel with Remote Listener
```bash
ssh -R 3000:127.0.0.1:22 backdoor@target1
```
- `3000` remote port
- `22` local port

## Fork Tunnel
Two forward tunnels with a local listener over a single TCP connection to `target1`
```bash
ssh -L 2000:target2:22 -L 2001:target2:80 user@target1
```
- `2000` local port for connection 1
- `22` remote port for connection 1
- `2001` local port for connection 2
- `80` remote port for connection 2

## Bidirectional Tunnel
Forward & Reverse Tunnels with Local & Reverse Listeners utilizing a single TCP connection to TARGET1
```bash
ssh -L 2000:target2:22 -R 3000:127.0.0.1:22 user@target1
```
- `2000` local port for forward listener
- `3000` remote port for reverse tunnel

## Tunnelception
SSH tunnel to `target3` through a tunnel to `target2` through a tunnel to `target1`
```bash
ssh -L 2000:target2:22 user@target1
ssh -L 2001:target3:22 -p2000 user@target2
```
- `2000` local port for `target2` connection
- `2001` local port for `target3` cibbection

## Add Session Tunnel
Add a Forward Tunnel in an active SSH session `target1`
```bash
# must be a fresh new line so hit enter and try again if you don't drop into menu
-L 2000:target2:22
```
- `2000` local port
