title: Passive Scanning
---

Passive scanning is the act of gathering information on your target without engaging with the machine directly. This allows you to conduct research without alerting your target.

## NSLookup

You can find what IP a domain name resolves to by using `nslookup`:
```sh
nslookup google.com

Server:         192.168.2.2
Address:        192.168.2.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   google.com
Address: 172.217.5.238df
Name:   google.com
Address: 2607:f8b0:4004:810::200e
```
The above output shows `google.com`'s `IPv4` and `IPv6` address.

## Shodan
You can use [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io) to gather information based on an IP. Using the example above, we can see additional information for `google.com` [here](https://www.shodan.io/host/172.217.5.238):

- Country
- Organization
- Internet service provider
- Contact information
- Ports open
- Services running

If you have a Shodan API key, you can use the CLI tool by running `shodan init [API_key]` and use the following:
```sh
shodan host 172.217.5.238
```

Shodan is a powerful tool that can be used to [expplore](https://www.shodan.io/explore) the internet for specific devices such as [open webcams](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Server%3A+SQ-WEBCAM) and [telnet logins with the password "1234"](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=input+password+%28defaul+1234%29)

## Searchsploit

Once you have information about your target (wether through [active scanning]() or means outlined above), you can use `searchsploit` for known vulnerabilities:

```sh
searchsploit [options] [term(s)]
```

### Useful Options

- `-c`: case sensitive (*default: case insensitive*)
- `-e`: enforces exact match on term order (*default: terms ANDed disregarding order*)
- `-s`: enforces strict matching, disabling fuzzy matching
- `--exclude"term1|term2"`: exclude provided terms from search results
- `--nmap [output.xml]`: uses an `nmap` XML report as input (use `-oX` or `-oA` flag in `nmap`)

### Updating Searchsploit

Searchsploit is backed by ExploitDB. To ensure you have the latest exploit database you can run `searchsploit -u`
