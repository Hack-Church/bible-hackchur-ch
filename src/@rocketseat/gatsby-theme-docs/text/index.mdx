# Introduction
The free and open source manual for cyber security.

Our intention is to compile tactics from real-world pentesting and CTF write-ups to make an exhaustive resource for expanding your cyber security knoweldge at any level. Additionally, it can and should be used as a spoiler-free reference during CTFs and practical cyber security certification exams.

## Pentesting Methodology
While it makes sense for most of the methodology to occur in the order listed, some steps may be optional or occur before others.

- ðŸ—ƒ Organization- Setting yourself up for success
- ðŸ”­ Recon - Perform active and passive scans
- ðŸ”“ Access - Get initial access on your target
- ðŸŽ– PrivEsc- Upgrade privileges on your target
- ðŸ“¦ Infil Exfil - Upload tools or download important information
- ðŸ§¹ Cleanup - Cover your tracks

## Reading this Guide
Throughout this guide commands are presented in a format intended to quickly convey the correct syntax and meaning. If warranted, certain parts of the command are clarified in a list following the command.

Here are some common shorthand used in this guide:
- `localhost` is interchangeable with `127.0.0.1` (see also [host machine](/glossary#host-machine))
- `target`, `target2`, etc is the IP of a [target machine](/glossary#target-machine) or machines
- `user` is a username for whatever you are trying to access
